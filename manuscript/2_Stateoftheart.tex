\section{State-of-the-art and progress beyond}\label{stateoftheart}
This section aims to provide an overview of relevant scientific contributions with respect to this paper's scope. Explicitly not part of the literature review is the already widely discussed topic of sharing renewable energy generation and related peer-to-peer innovations in the light of energy communities. A general study comprehensively dealing with the sharing economy is provided by Codagnone and Martens \cite{codagnone2016scoping}. The reviews from Sousa et al. \cite{sousa2019peer} and Koirala et al. \cite{koirala2016energetic} go into even more depth and with resepect to peer-to-peer energy sharing and energy communities. Against this background, the focus here lies on three different aspects without claiming to be absolutely complete in each case. The first aspect is the decarbonization of heating and cooling systems from a system analysis perspective and is described in Section \ref{aspect1}. The second aspect deals with the increasingly importance of justice in the energy system transition and is presented in Section \ref{aspect2}. The third aspect is dedicated to the trade-offs analysis of investment decisions into renewable energy technologies including realted contracting business cases and is discussed in Section \ref{aspect3}. The choice of these focal points, as well as the explicit exclusion of the mentioned topics, are deliberately chosen in order to reflect the DNA of the analysis. 

\subsection{Decarbonizing the provision of heating service needs}\label{aspect1}
The insights obtained from various scientific studies allow us to see the big picture of a decarbonized heating and cooling sector. A fundamental change of the energy carrier mix, alongside a significant efficiency increase, is necessary for a sustainable heating and cooling service need supply. For example, Connolly et al. \cite{connolly2014heat} provide in their study such a strategy and present a decarbonization roadmap for the European heating sector. They propose a new sustainable heat strategy that is based on changes on the demand-side and supply-side. In addition to significant heat savings, integrating sustainable heat sources into centralized heat networks (or district heating networks) and electrifying heat supply (e.g., heat pump) are suggested to achieve a low-carbon heating sector. Seyboth et al. \cite{seyboth2008recognising} focus in their study on supportive energy policy recommendations to enhance the deployment of renewable energy heating and cooling technologies. In particular, this means the integration of renewable sources such as solar, geothermal, and biomass into heating and cooling systems.\vspace{0.5cm}

In general, the sustainable heat source or heat generation technology that is ultimately implemented/used at the end-user levels depends on a number of factors. Among these, geographical and spatial characteristics, in particular, play a crucial role. Su et al. \cite{su2018heating} deal in their study with optimal sustainable heating system alternatives with a special focus on local geographical features of the application site. Their results show that there might not be a one-fits-all solution if decarbonizing local heating systems. However, certain trends are very much emerging in their findings, which can also be confirmed by further case studies. Renewable-fed district heating networks have significant potential to supply heat demand in urban areas. This is exemplarily also shown by the results of Popovski et al. \cite{popovski2018technical}. They state that from a socio-economic perspective, district heating networks with excess heat are the most favorable supply option in densely populated areas. Lake et al. \cite{lake2017review} present a comprehensive review of district heating and cooling systems. They analyze among others the economic feasibility and system identification based on primary energy sources of centralized heating and cooling networks. Rama et al. \cite{rama2018introduction} study the optimal combination of different sustainable heating alternatives.In particular, they show how heat pumps and solarthermal can assist district heating networks. There exist also other alternatives. Sopha et al. \cite{sopha2011exploring} focus in their study on the potential of wood-pellet in Norway, a country with high shares of district heating-based heat supply. They use an agent-based model to identify energy policy options supporting the uptake of such sustainable heating systems. The authors conclude that a stable financial support (i.e., stable wood-pellet price) has the highest impact on the transition of wood-pellet. We refer to Section \ref{aspect3} in this context for a detailed discussion of financial incentives for renewable energy technologies in the heating sector.\vspace{0.5cm}

In any case, there is a need for sustainable alternatives to district heating. Either to complement existing district heating networks in a high-efficient way (e.g., \cite{rama2018introduction} and \cite{sopha2011exploring}) and/or because to compensate non-existing networks in the future. Popovski et al. \cite{popovski2018technical} identify the electrification of the heat supply using heat pumps with photovoltaics as the most cost-competitive alternative from a socio-economic perspective. Leibowicz et al. \cite{leibowicz2018optimal} also show end-use electrification as an optimal strategy for the decarbonization of the heating sector. However, the authors state that the electrification using heat pumps for example only makes sense in combination with building thermal efficiency improvements.\vspace{0.5cm}

In order to emphasize the importance of building renovation measures, we dedicate this concluding paragraph the corresponding literature. In particular, we select papers focusing on the impact of different retorfitting measures on sustainable heating system alternatives. However, we do not differentiate here in detail between different types of retrofitting measures (e.g., purely passive, passive, active, etc.) and refer in this context to the comprehensive literature review of Fina et al. in \cite{fina2019profitability}. Ma et al. \cite{ma2012existing} provide an extensive literature and state-of-the-art analysis of retrofitting focusing on existing buildings. Vieites et al. \cite{vieites2015european} elaborate in this context of European initiatives improving  the energy efficiency in existing and old (historic) buildings. Recently, Weinberger et al. \cite{weinberger2021investigating} investigate the impact of retrofitting on district heating networks. Fina et al. \cite{fina2019profitability} put their focus on the profitability of retrofitting of multi-apartment buildings with special consideration of different heating systems. They thoroughly study the implementation of the combination of building-attached/integrated photovoltaics supporting sustainable heating systems. Their results show how (passive) retrofitting measures result in a reduction of the required installed heating system capacity. However, the energy cost reduction achieved from higher building standards are not able to compensate the initial passive renovation investment costs. They conclude that latter significantly depend on the development of the CO\textsubscript{2} price and the assumptions of end-user investment grants as well as subsidies. We again take up these findings associated with financial support in Section \ref{aspect3}
