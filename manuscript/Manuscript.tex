\begin{abstract}
	The core objective of this work is to demonstrate equitable decarbonization of heat supply in residential multi-apartment rental buildings. A modeling framework is developed determining a socially balanced financial governance support strategy between the property owner and tenants to trigger a heating system change. The results of different decarbonization scenarios of a partly renovated old building switching from gas-fired heat supply to either the district heating network or being equipped with a heat pump system show that an equitable heating system change is possible, but with massive public subsidy payments. Particularly, the investment grant to the property owner and additional rent-related revenues due to building renovation are decisive for the profitability of the investment. Simultaneously, subsidy payments to the tenants are required at the beginning of the investment period to limit their energy and rent-related spendings. Results also show that the heat pump alternative is not competitive compared with district heating, even in case of extensive retrofitting of the building. Allocating the costs of inaction (opportunity costs associated with rising CO\textsubscript{2} prices) between the governance, property owner, and tenants turns out as an important lever, as required subsidy payments can be reduced significantly.

\section{\added{Illustration of the model}}\label{appendix:ill}
This section aims to test \added{and illustrate} the presented model and its functionalities. However, a model validation using existing empirical data cannot be applied in this case. There is simply a lack of comparable data from real world examples. Therefore, an illustrative case study is chosen to demonstrate the main functionalities and to verify the model. We assume a single property owner and a tenant in a representative single-family house switching to a heat pump. In this simple verification example, it is assumed that the property owner's and tenant's interest rate is equal (\SI{3}{\%}). A detailed description of the empirical settings can be found in \ref{tab:a2}. Figure \ref{val:npv} shows the net present value of the financial support for both property owner (a) and tenant (b).

Until $2040$, both agents receive equal financial support with a total of \SI{13750}{EUR}. One-fifth of the property owner's support is paid as an investment grant directly and four-fifths as rent-charge related revenues from the tenants. The tenant receives a heating costs subsidy. In sum, the governance pays \SI{16500}{EUR}. Thus, the total level of financial support for exchanging the heating system results exactly in (i) a property owner's net present value of cash flows equal to zero within the time horizon of 15 years (see Figure \ref{fig:landlord}) and (ii) a constant remaining net present value of the tenant's energy and rent charges compared with the existing (e.g., gas-fired) heating system (see Figure \ref{fig:tenant}).

\section{Passive building retrofitting measures}\label{app:passive}
We consider passive retrofitting measures in this study in a very simplified way and focus here on the insulation of the building skin and the wall to neighboring buildings only. The economic and technical assumptions are oriented to the study from Fina et al. in \cite{fina2020profitability}. \added{Accordingly, we assume passive retrofitting investment costs of} \SI{1.75}{EUR \per kWh}. \added{Besides,} the following relationships between the specific heat demand and the heat pump's (average) coefficient of performance (COP) are assumed: \SI{130}{kWh \per m^2} (COP$=2.5$), \SI{115}{kWh \per m^2} ($3.0$), \SI{100}{kWh \per m^2} ($3.5$). 

%\section{Empirical settings of the case example}\label{app:verify}


\section{Varying allocation of the costs of inaction}\label{app:varying}
This work considers the CO\textsubscript{2} price-related costs as the costs of inaction and opportunity costs (OC) respectively. Hence, Equation \ref{app:eq:inaction} describes the costs of inaction per year $y$ and month $m$

\begin{align}\label{app:eq:inaction}
	OC_{y,m} =    \gamma_{init} \cdot p_{y}^{CO\textsubscript{2}} \cdot d_{y,m}
\end{align}

where $\gamma_{init}$ is the specific emissions of the initial heating system (i.e., natural gas) and $p_{y}^{CO\textsubscript{2}}$ the CO\textsubscript{2} price in year $y$ and month $m$. Exemplarily, Equation \ref{app:eq:landlord1} shows the property owner's net present value in total when a part of the total OC is allocated to the property owner's net present value

\begin{align}\label{app:eq:landlord1}
	OC_{l} =  \sum_{y} \sum_{m} s_l \cdot \frac{OC_{y,m}}{(1+i_l)^y} 
\end{align}

where $s_l$ is the share in the costs of inaction borne by the property owner. Consequently, Equation \ref{c:npv} is modified as follows by considering the property owner's costs of inaction.

\begin{align}\label{app:eq:landlord}
	-OC_{l} =  -\zeta + \sum_{y} \sum_{m} \frac{1}{(1+i_l)^y} \cdot \lambda_{y,m}
\end{align}

A similar logic is developed in the modification of the tenant's net present value. The tenant's share of the costs of inaction ($OC_{t}$) are considered in Equation \ref{c:ten4}. The tenant's OCs influence the initial spendings that are assumed to be the limit in the sustainable heating system alternative (see Equation \ref{c:app:tenant}).

\begin{align}\label{c:app:tenant}
	K_{alt} = K_{init} - OC_{t}
\end{align}
